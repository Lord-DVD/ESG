# Economic Scenario Generator
* This report tries to propose a simple economic scenario generator encomappsing most basic economic parameters, focusing mainly on long term economic outcomes. It focuses on follwing most stylized facts about a comprehensive ESG, and an explainable cascasding structure.
* This was made by me in fulfillment of the project requirement for the course ACMA830 toward the degree of Master of Science in Actuarial Science at Simon Fraser University, BC, Canada.
* It follows a cascade structure similar to SOA-CAS model of 2005 and has direct applications to ALM functions for all financial instutuions.  
* You can find the full description of the modelling and code in the report, [here](https://github.com/Lord-DVD/ESG/blob/main/DesaiVatsal_ACMA830_Project2_Report.pdf)
